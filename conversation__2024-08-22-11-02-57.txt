AI: To stay protected from phishing:

1. Be cautious with links and attachments in emails, messages, or any form of online communication. Verify the authenticity of senders and hover over links to check their destination before clicking.
2. Use two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible, especially on accounts that handle sensitive information like banking, email, or social media. This adds an extra layer of security against phishing attempts that rely on password guessing or stealing.
