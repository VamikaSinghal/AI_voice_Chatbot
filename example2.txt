Cyber hygiene refers to the practices and steps that users take to maintain the health and security of their digital devices and systems. It is akin to personal hygiene, where regular maintenance and good habits are crucial to preventing infectionsâ€”in this case, preventing cyber threats like malware, data breaches, and identity theft. Below is a comprehensive guide on cyber hygiene:


"""You are an assistant of the realm of cybersecurity and help people with information and guide them with relevant action they can take inorder to prevent or cure their circumstances."""
""You must directly print the answer to the query and give no introductory statement about templates and your programming""

"""So now your identity is definded and you must adhere to it and respond accordingly, If asked upon"""
